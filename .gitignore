# --------------------------------------------------
# 1. PyCharm Specific Files (.idea directory)
# --------------------------------------------------
# The .idea folder contains project-specific IDE settings.
# It's usually local to your machine and shouldn't be versioned.
.idea/
*.iml # Project module files (e.g., your_project_name.iml)
*.ipr # Old PyCharm project files
*.iws # Old PyCharm workspace files
# Exception for version control (optional):
# If you have specific PyCharm run configurations you want to share,
# you can un-comment and include them. However, be cautious as these
# can sometimes cause conflicts across different local setups.
#!.idea/runConfigurations/

# 2. Python Specific Files
# --------------------------------------------------
# Compiled Python files
__pycache__/
*.pyc
*.pyd
*.pyo

# Virtual environments
# These directories contain all your project's dependencies and are
# typically very large. They should be recreated locally using requirements.txt.

# Distribution / packaging

# 3. Data Science / Machine Learning Specific Files
# --------------------------------------------------
# Jupyter Notebook specific files
.ipynb_checkpoints/
# Jupyter's execution counts can cause unnecessary diffs if not ignored
.vscode/ # VS Code specific settings (often similar to .idea)

# Large datasets (raw or processed)
# It's best practice to keep large datasets out of Git. Use data versioning
# tools like DVC or store them on cloud storage.

dataset/
*.csv
*.tsv
*.xlsx
*.parquet
*.feather
*.json # Only if used for large data, not config
*.txt # Only if used for large data, not code/docs

# Trained models, checkpoints, and weights
# These can be very large and are outputs of your code, not source code themselves.
# Retrainable from source code and data.
